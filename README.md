# HSG Movie Recommendation System
Group project by Lorenzo Dei Tos, Federico Farhanghi, Valerie Grossrieder, Roman Kastl, Nils Kaufmann, and Marko Kosutov as part of the "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" course during the Spring Semester 2020 at the University of St. Gallen.

The base code for our project comes from Data Flair: https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-r-movie-recommendation/

# Motivation
We have developed a machine learning project to implement a Recommendation System with the objective of recommending movies to users. Recommendation Systems are gaining increasing attention from e-commerce platforms and online streaming services, e.g., Amazon, Netflix, YouTube. Companies are investing good portions of their budgets on the realisation of sophisticated Recommendation Systems. By analysing the customer’s preferences, companies can better identify the products and services with higher likelihood of purchase, and ultimately increase customer loyalty and retention.

# Recommendation System
A Recommendation System is able to learn the watching patterns of users and provide them with relevant suggestions. The way it works is relatively simple: The System applies a filtering process based on user preferences and browsing history and ultimately returns recommendations of movies as displayed in the picture.
 
# Dataset
MovieLens Database includes 27 million ratings of 58,000 movies by 280,000 users. It was created by GroupLens, a research lab of the University of Minnesota. Our Recommendation System is based on a subset of MovieLens Dataset and it comprises 105,339 ratings on 10,329 movies.

# Functionalities
We used the code on Data Flair and implemented four additional different algorithms in order to analyse the data: Decision Tree, Perceptron, kNN Algorithm, and Logistic Regression.

# How to use the Recommendation System
1. Download all the files in the same folder
2. Set the working directory to the folder "code"
3. Run the code in the order

Required packages will be installed automatically: plotly, ggthemes, scales, datetime, recommenderlab, ggplot2, data.table, reshape2, stringr, tree, class, plyr, formattable
